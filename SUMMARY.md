# gh-ai-aligned: Complete Solution Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created **gh-ai-aligned**, a GitHub CLI extension that combines the AI detection capabilities from ai-aligned-git with the token exchange functionality from as-a-bot. This ensures that all GitHub actions performed by AI tools are properly attributed to a bot acting on behalf of the user.

## Architecture

The solution consists of:

### 1. Core Script (`gh-ai`)
- **AI Detection**: Detects AI tools through process tree analysis and environment variables
- **Token Exchange**: Exchanges user tokens for bot tokens via the as-a-bot service
- **Transparent Passthrough**: When no AI is detected, passes commands directly to gh
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Installation Script (`install.sh`)
- Installs the extension in the proper gh extensions directory
- Verifies prerequisites (gh CLI installation)
- Supports both local and remote installation via curl

### 3. Test Suite (`test.sh`)
- Validates AI detection for multiple tools
- Tests authentication and repository detection
- Verifies passthrough behavior

### 4. Documentation (`README.md`)
- Comprehensive usage instructions
- Architecture diagrams
- Troubleshooting guide
- Configuration options

## Key Features

### AI Detection
Supports detection of:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Cursor
- Gemini (Google)
- Qwen Code (Alibaba)
- Zed AI
- OpenCode

Detection methods:
- Process tree analysis
- Environment variable checks
- Configurable forcing via env vars

### Token Exchange Flow
1. Detects current repository from git config
2. Verifies as-a-bot app installation
3. Exchanges user token for bot token
4. Executes gh command with bot token

### Security & Privacy
- No token storage
- On-demand token exchange
- Preserves user permissions
- Full audit trail

## How It Works

```bash
# When an AI uses gh:
gh ai pr create --title "Fix bug"

# The extension:
1. Detects AI (e.g., Claude)
2. Gets repo info (owner/repo)
3. Checks app installation
4. Exchanges token via as-a-bot
5. Runs: GH_TOKEN=<bot_token> gh pr create --title "Fix bug"

# Result: PR created by "as-a-bot[bot]" on behalf of user
```

## Installation

```bash
# One-line install (when published):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/gh-ai-aligned/main/install.sh | sh

# Or local install:
./install.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
# Direct usage
gh ai <any-gh-command>

# With alias
alias gh='gh ai'

# Debug mode
GH_AI_DEBUG=true gh ai auth status
```

## Testing Results

The solution has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Correctly detect multiple AI tools
- ✅ Exchange tokens when app is installed
- ✅ Pass through when no AI detected
- ✅ Handle missing app installation gracefully
- ✅ Work with all gh commands

## Files Created

1. `gh-ai` - Main extension script (9.6KB)
2. `install.sh` - Installation script (2.7KB)
3. `test.sh` - Test suite (3.9KB)
4. `README.md` - Documentation (7KB)
5. `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license (9.1KB)

## Next Steps

To use this solution:

1. **Install the as-a-bot GitHub App** on your repositories:
   https://github.com/apps/as-a-bot-app

2. **Install the extension**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Configure your AI tool** to use `gh ai` instead of `gh`, or set up an alias

4. **Test it**:
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_CODE=1 GH_AI_DEBUG=true gh ai auth status
   ```

## Benefits

- **Proper Attribution**: All AI actions are clearly marked as bot actions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into what was done by AI vs humans
- **No User Impersonation**: AI can't pretend to be the user
- **Transparent**: Works seamlessly with existing gh workflows
- **Extensible**: Easy to add support for new AI tools

This solution successfully addresses the requirement to ensure AI-performed GitHub actions are properly attributed while maintaining a seamless developer experience.
